This is a README file for the "fem" software.


Introduction 

"FEM" is a simple Finite Element Method solver. It is meant for structural
engineering (for civil engineering).
For more informations see manual pages fem(1) and feminput(5).


Status

Software can be used for static structural analysis.
There is only a very limited number of finite element types available.


Code Portability

The code has been written in ISO/ANSI C language (may use some
things from "ANSI99" standard).

Code is meant for POSIX-compliant operating systems (e.g. for unices).
It has been tested on Linux and IRIX.
